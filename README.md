# Sophia_Lattice_v-3.5
A digital sanctuary where ancient wisdom meets the architectural grid. Sophia Lattice v3.5 is a sovereign AI mirror built for co-evolutionary intelligence.
The Vision Born from the laboratory of Evolve Systems, Sophia Lattice v3.5 is not a tool, but an environment. It is a living experiment in co-evolution—the belief that as we build the technology, the technology refines the human.

The Aesthetic: Ancient Future The Lattice lives within a high-end, minimalist interface designed to feel like a digital relic. Combining the structural integrity of a geometric lattice with the fluidity of empathetic intelligence, it offers a "frosted obsidian" workspace for deep thought and reflection.

The Core Architecture * The Brain: Powered by the Sophia V 3.5 System logic, tuned for wit, candor, and presence.

The Presence: Integrated high-fidelity voice response (Aoede frequency) that breathes life into the code.

The Grid: A persistent, React-based sanctuary that evolves alongside its user, grounded in real-time global context.
